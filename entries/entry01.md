# Entry 1

I'm really looking forward working on the the freedom project throughout the year. It is allowing me to choose a topic that I may be interested in. One thing I do have to keep in mind is I should have a purpose. I need to let the reader aware of a topic and make them question their decesion making twice. I personally want people to read my website and go work on the specific advice I gave them or share it with other people. 

With these points in mind, I have choosen to let people, especially teenagers aware of how important sleep is. We constantly get told we should get eight hours of sleep but why? I want to let teenagers aware of how lack of sleep is going to effect their preformance in all activities. Some factors that could get affected could be doing classwork, homework or even worse, your mental health. To add on, I also want to let teenagers aware how thier behavior and emotaional health may be affected. This may affect them greatly because it may ruin certain relationships without the intention of doing so. People don't realize how certain devices like computers, phones or tvs can effect how easy it is to sleep. To put it in to simply words I want to give people advice on how they could sleep easier and what would happen if they don't.

Moving on from now I want to do some research on how technology effects how you sleep. I do know some things about blue lights but not in full detail. I also need to do some reasearch on how to imporve sleep and how to sleep easier. Doing this research will make me let the reader aware of sleep and its importance.
