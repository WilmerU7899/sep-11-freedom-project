# Entry 1

I'm really looking forward working on the the freedom project throughout the year. It is allowing me to choose a topic that I may be interested in. One thing I do have to keep in mind is I should have a purpose. I need to let the reader aware of a topic and make them question their decesion making twice. I personally want people to read my website and go work on the specific advice I gave them or share it with other people. 

With these points in mind I have choosen to let people especially teenagers aware of how important sleep is. We constantly get told we should get eight hours of sleep but why? I want to let teenagers aware of how lack of sleep is going to effect your preformance in all activities that get done. Some activities that could get affected can be doing classwork, homework or even worse your mental health. To add on, I want to let teenagers how lack of sleep may affect how they behave with others. This may affect them greatly if they have to present a project or if they are applying for a job. If they do have a job lack of sleep could affect thier preformance levels.
